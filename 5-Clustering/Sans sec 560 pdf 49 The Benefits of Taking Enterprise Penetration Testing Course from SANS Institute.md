If you are looking for a comprehensive and hands-on course on network penetration testing and ethical hacking, you might want to consider SEC560: Enterprise Penetration Testing Course offered by SANS Institute[^1^]. This course covers the entire process of planning, preparing, executing, and reporting a penetration test for a modern enterprise, including on-premise systems, Azure, and Azure AD. You will learn how to use the latest tools and techniques to identify and exploit vulnerabilities at scale and show real business risk to your organization.
 
The course consists of six days of lectures and labs, culminating with a final Capture-the-Flag exercise where you will conduct a penetration test against a sample target organization. The course is designed for both experienced penetration testers who want to sharpen their skills and learn new methods, as well as system administrators, defenders, and other security professionals who want to understand the mindset and methodology of a modern attacker. The course also prepares you for the GIAC Penetration Tester (GPEN) certification exam[^2^], which validates your ability to conduct a professional penetration test.
