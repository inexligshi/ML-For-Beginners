It Was Written is not only a great album by Nas, but also a landmark in hip-hop culture. It marked the emergence of Nas as a mainstream star, as well as the popularity of mafioso rap, a subgenre that depicts the lives and fantasies of gangsters and drug lords. Nas was inspired by movies such as Scarface and The Godfather, as well as by his own experiences growing up in Queensbridge, New York. He adopted the alter ego of Nas Escobar, a reference to the notorious Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar.
 
It Was Written also introduced the world to The Firm, a supergroup consisting of Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Cormega. The group made their debut on the track "Affirmative Action", where they rapped about their criminal exploits and wealth. The Firm was supposed to release an album together, but due to creative differences and label issues, Cormega was replaced by Nature and the album was delayed until 1997. The Firm: The Album received mixed reviews and failed to live up to the expectations set by It Was Written.
 
Despite its success and influence, It Was Written also faced some criticism from fans and critics who preferred Nas's debut album Illmatic. They felt that Nas had compromised his artistic integrity and sold out to the mainstream market. They also accused him of copying the style and themes of other rappers such as Raekwon and The Notorious B.I.G., who had released similar albums before him. Nas defended his artistic choices and claimed that he was evolving as an artist and expanding his horizons. He also said that he wanted to reach a wider audience and make more money for himself and his family.
