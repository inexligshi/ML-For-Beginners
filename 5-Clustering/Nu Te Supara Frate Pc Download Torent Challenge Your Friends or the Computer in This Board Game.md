If you want to learn how to play Nu Te Supara Frate, you need to know the basic rules and strategies of the game. The game is played on a special board with four colored sections, each with a home base (B) and a starting point (A). Each player has four pieces of the same color, which they have to move around the board and bring them back to their home base. The first player to do so wins the game.
 
To start the game, each player rolls the dice and the one who gets a 6 goes first. The player has to move one of their pieces from their home base to their starting point. Then, they can roll the dice again and move their piece according to the number they get. For example, if they get a 4, they can move their piece four spaces clockwise on the board. If they get another 6, they can either move another piece from their home base to their starting point, or move their existing piece six spaces.

The game gets more interesting when the players encounter each other's pieces on the board. If a player lands on a space occupied by another player's piece, they can capture it and send it back to its home base. This is where the game gets its name, as the captured player may get angry and say "Nu te supara frate" ("Don't get mad, brother"). However, there are some safe spaces on the board where the pieces cannot be captured. These are marked with stars or circles and are usually located at the corners of each section.
 
The game also requires some strategy and planning, as the players have to decide which piece to move and when. Sometimes, it may be better to wait for a 6 before moving a piece from the home base, or to avoid capturing another player's piece if it means exposing your own piece to danger. The game also involves some luck, as the dice can make or break your chances of winning.
 
Nu Te Supara Frate is a game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds. It is easy to learn, fun to play, and challenging to master. It is also a great way to bond with your friends and family, as you share laughs and frustrations over the game. You can play it online or offline, on your PC or on a physical board. No matter how you play it, you will surely have a good time with Nu Te Supara Frate.
