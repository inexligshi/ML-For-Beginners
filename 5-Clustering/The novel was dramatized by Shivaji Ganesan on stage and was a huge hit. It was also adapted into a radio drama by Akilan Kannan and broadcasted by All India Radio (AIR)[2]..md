One of the most remarkable achievements of Rajendra Chola was his overseas conquests. He was the first Indian king to launch naval expeditions that reached beyond the Indian Ocean. He sent a large fleet of ships to attack the Srivijaya kingdom, which was a powerful maritime empire that controlled the trade routes between India and China. Rajendra Chola defeated the Srivijaya king Sangrama Vijayatungavarman and captured his capital Kadaram (modern Kedah in Malaysia). He also plundered other cities and ports in Sumatra, Java, Malaya and the Malay Peninsula. He established his authority over the islands of Andaman and Nicobar, Lakshadweep and Maldives. He also received tributes and gifts from the kings of Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
 
Rajendra Chola was not only a great conqueror but also a great builder and patron of arts and culture. He founded a new city called Gangaikonda Cholapuram, which means "the city of the Chola who conquered the Ganges". He built a magnificent temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, which rivaled the Brihadisvara temple built by his father in Thanjavur. He also constructed many other temples, palaces, tanks, canals and roads in his empire. He encouraged literature, education, music and dance. He supported many poets and scholars who composed works in Tamil and Sanskrit. He also issued many inscriptions that recorded his achievements and donations.
 
Vengaiyin Maindhan is a novel that celebrates the glory and greatness of Rajendra Chola and his empire. It is a novel that transports the reader to a fascinating era of history, where courage, romance, adventure and culture flourished. It is a novel that showcases the pride and heritage of the Tamil people and their contribution to world civilization.
