## Who was Gershom Scholem?
 
Gershom Scholem was born on December 5, 1897, in Berlin, Germany, to a secular Jewish family. He was interested in Jewish culture and history from an early age and learned Hebrew and Aramaic on his own. He also became fascinated by the Kabbalah, which he discovered through reading books and manuscripts in libraries and private collections.
 
He studied mathematics, philosophy, and Hebrew at various universities in Germany and Switzerland, but he was dissatisfied with the academic approach to Judaism and Zionism. He decided to emigrate to Palestine in 1923, where he joined the newly founded Hebrew University of Jerusalem as a librarian. He soon became a lecturer and then a professor of Jewish mysticism, a position he held until his retirement in 1965.
 
He married Fania Freud in 1929 and had two sons with her. He died on February 21, 1982, in Jerusalem, Israel.

- "Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism" (1941), which is considered his magnum opus and a classic introduction to the Kabbalah for general readers.
- "Origins of the Kabbalah" (1962), which is a comprehensive study of the emergence and development of the Kabbalah in medieval Europe.
- "Sabbatai Zevi: The Mystical Messiah" (1973), which is a biography of the 17th-century Jewish false messiah who claimed to be the incarnation of God.
- "Kabbalah" (1974), which is a concise overview of the main themes and concepts of the Kabbalah for beginners.
- "On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead" (1991), which is a collection of essays on various topics related to the Kabbalah's understanding of God's nature and attributes.

## Why is Gershom Scholem important?
 
Gershom Scholem is important because he was the first scholar to apply rigorous historical and philological methods to the study of the Kabbalah. He revealed the richness and diversity of this tradition that had been largely ignored or misunderstood by previous generations of scholars and thinkers. He also showed how the Kabbalah was not only a mystical phenomenon but also a cultural and intellectual one that influenced many aspects of Jewish life and thought throughout history.
 
Gershom Scholem also inspired many other scholars and writers who followed his footsteps or engaged with his ideas. Some of them include Martin Buber, Walter Benjamin, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, Harold Bloom, Moshe Idel, Elliot Wolfson, Daniel Matt, Arthur Green, Lawrence Fine, David Biale
