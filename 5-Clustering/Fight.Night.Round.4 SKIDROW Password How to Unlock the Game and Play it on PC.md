However, Fight Night Round 4 is not officially available for PC, and some users may resort to downloading pirated versions of the game from torrent sites. These versions often come with a password-protected archive file that requires a crack or a keygen to unlock. One of the most common sources of these files is SKIDROW, a group of hackers who release cracked games and software.
 
Unfortunately, many of these files are fake or malicious, and may contain viruses, malware or ransomware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Some of them may also ask you to complete surveys or download additional software to get the password, which is usually a scam. Therefore, it is not recommended to download or use these files, as they are illegal and unsafe.

If you want to play Fight Night Round 4 on PC, you may try using an emulator such as RPCS3, which can run PlayStation 3 games on Windows. However, this method may require a powerful PC and a legal copy of the game disc. Alternatively, you can wait for EA Sports to release a remastered version of the game for PC, as they have done with other titles such as Mass Effect and Dead Space.
 
In conclusion, Fight Night Round 4 is a great boxing game that is unfortunately not available for PC. Downloading cracked versions of the game from SKIDROW or other sources is risky and illegal, and may not even work. The best way to enjoy the game on PC is to use an emulator or hope for a remastered edition in the future.

Here are some tips on how to play Fight Night Round 4 effectively:
 
- Learn the basics of the controls, such as how to punch, block, dodge and clinch. You can practice in the training mode or watch the tutorials in the game menu.
- Choose a boxer that suits your style and preference. You can select from different categories such as speed, power, defense and stamina. You can also customize your own boxer in the career mode and upgrade their skills and attributes.
- Study your opponent's strengths and weaknesses. You can view their stats and tendencies in the pre-fight screen or during the fight. You can also watch replays of their previous fights to learn their patterns and habits.
- Use different strategies and tactics depending on the situation. You can switch between different stances, such as orthodox and southpaw, to confuse your opponent. You can also use different combinations of punches, such as jabs, hooks, uppercuts and haymakers, to create openings and deal damage.
- Manage your stamina and health. You can see your stamina bar at the bottom of the screen, which depletes when you throw punches or move around. If your stamina is low, you will be slower and weaker, and more vulnerable to knockouts. You can also see your health bar at the top of the screen, which shows how much damage you have taken. If your health is low, you will be more likely to get stunned or knocked down by your opponent's punches.
- Use your signature moves and flash knockouts. Each boxer has a signature move that can be activated by pressing a certain button combination when your momentum meter is full. These moves are powerful and can turn the tide of the fight in your favor. You can also trigger a flash knockout by landing a perfect punch at the right moment, which can instantly knock out your opponent.

By following these tips, you can improve your skills and performance in Fight Night Round 4. Have fun and good luck!
