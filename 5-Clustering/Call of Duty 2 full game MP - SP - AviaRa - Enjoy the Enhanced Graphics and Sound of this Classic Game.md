- "Call of Duty 2 is just about everything you would hope for and expect from the sequel to one of the most successful World War II shooters of all time. Its varied campaign, excellent sound and visuals, and addictive multiplayer make it a must-have for any fan of the genre." - GameSpot[^1^]
- "This is the World War II shooter to end all World War II shooters. Itâs not original, subtle or particularly innovative. Itâs not out to provide the most realistic depiction of the war. It doesnât give you a mass of clever tactical options or open battlefields where you can do things your way. It simply creates the most intense, exhilarating, sometimes terrifying and frequently exhausting experience of combat around." - Trusted Reviews[^2^]
- "Sound is where Call of Duty 2 excels like no other FPS. From the stirring score that kicks up during key moments, to the top-notch gun and explosion effects, the game sounds fantastic. And if you have a surround sound setup, you're in for a real treat." - GameSpot[^3^]

Call of Duty 2 is a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Whether you are storming the beaches of Normandy, sniping enemies from a rooftop in Stalingrad, or sabotaging tanks in North Africa, you will feel like you are part of history. If you are looking for a thrilling and immersive shooter game that will test your skills and nerves, look no further than Call of Duty 2.
